# Movie-Recommender-System


This is a Streamlit app for a movie recommendation system. The app displays a dropdown menu with a list of movie titles to choose from. Once a user selects a movie and clicks the "Recommender" button, the app returns five movie recommendations with their posters. The app utilizes the MovieLens dataset and the TMDb API to fetch the movie posters. The recommendation system is built using cosine similarity scores, and the preprocessed data is stored in two pickle files: 'movies_dictionary.pkl' and 'similarity.pkl'.
